## News from the community

### Resources on remote collaboration

On 11 March, The Turing Way team started to build resources on the currently relevant topic of [Remote Collaboration](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/960).
Thanks to the attendees from the Collaboration Cafe in March and Collaboration Workshop 2020, we have now [11 issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/labels/collaboration-book) and multiple chapters on remote participation and collaboration in projects, events and teams.
You are welcome to review these contributions and add your own content that we can add to the book for others in the community to benefit from.

### New chapters and new book design under development

Carlos Martinez and Stefan Verhoeven added [a chapter on software licensing](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/licensing/licensing.html). You contribution regarding data licensing will be extremely useful for extending their work and offering a wider understaning of licenses in Data Research.

We are also working on the new design of the book ([see this preview](https://deploy-preview-977--the-turing-way.netlify.com/welcome)), which aims to provide easier access to the book and its different sections.

## Relevant resources

### Translation efforts and 3 issues

Anna Hadjitofi has written [a guide to using the Transifex‚Äôs interface](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/translation/translation_guide.md) that Tony Yang is currently coordinating for The Turing Way Translation efforts.
They recommend at least 2 people work on translating so that they can review each other's translations.
Transifex also allows you to raise issues and browse the past translations.

Tony has opened the [GitHub issues with the label ‚ÄúTranslation‚Äù](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/labels/translation) to track the progress and discussions, start with [this meta-issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/967) to get an overview of all the discussions around translation.
He has also set up a netlify build on the translation branch that can be previewed for [Chinese version here](https://competent-nightingale-4c1d36.netlify.com/zh_cn/introduction/introduction) and [the Spanish version here](https://competent-nightingale-4c1d36.netlify.com/es/introduction/introduction).

### The Hidden REF announces new categories

[The Hidden REF](https://hidden-ref.org/), an initiative to celebrate all research outputs and their contributors, just announced new categories under which outputs and people can be submitted.
As a complement to the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise run in the UK, the Hidden REF will highlight outputs that are not selected or eligible for REF.
Until the end of June, the research community can suggest and comment on categories for which submissions should be accepted.
[Latest suggestions](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-04-06-first-look-new-categories-hidden-ref) include training material such as the Turing Way resources or carpentry lessons, data and metadata standards, colleagues working in professional services and others.
To keep up to date with the Hidden REF, follow the initiative [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/HiddenRef).

### Mindful activities and Cross-Stich Carpentry

Are you looking for some non-digital time after spending the entire day working online and attending virtual meetings?
Check this [Carpentries-style lesson on cross stitching](https://sgibson91.github.io/cross-stitch-carpentry/index.html) that Sarah Gibson recently launched to get beginners started with this mindful hobby.
You can also read [this post](https://sgibson91.github.io/cross-stitch-carpentry/motivation/index.html) where Sarah and Malvika give more reasons for computer programmers and The Turing Way community members to take time for mindful activities that can have positive impact on your mental health and well-being.

## Tips & Tricks for new contributors

If you are new to GitHub or The Turing Way or both, here are a few resources to orient yourself with our project repository:
* Start by reading our [contribution guideline](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), that lists the different pathways for the new and existing contributors to interact with this project.
* [GitHub issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues) are opened by different contributors on the issues of topics they are interested in flagging, fixing or working on.
* You can browse them by labels (see [contributing through GitHub section](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-through-github), participate in a conversation by adding your comment under the respective issues or open a new issue on the topic where you would like to gather feedback from others.
* We also have [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to help our new contributors start by contributing little because every little bit helps.
* You are welcome to introduce yourself to others on [our Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), or reach out to Malvika, The Turing Way community manager, by emailing [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com).

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

### Highlights from the Collaboration Workshop 2020

Several members from The Turing Way community participated at the [Virtual Collaboration Workshop 2020](https://software.ac.uk/events/2019-11-20-collaborations-workshop-2020), that was organised by Rachael Ainsworth, Community Manager of the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), from 31 March to 2 April 2020.
Look out for recordings and blog posts on [SSI homepage](https://software.ac.uk) soon.
Meanwhile, here are some notable mentions from the event:
* Andrew J. Steward in his keynote on Open Research discussed the existing challenges around reproducibility in Open research in psychology and ways we can improve them ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sN8xdUYD9flusHxR0SfTFy7EpLaGiDAK/view?usp=sharing)).
* Becca Wilson in her keynote gave us a thorough overview of Data Privacy, different policies across different countries, pseudonymisation to replace identifiable information from the public data, and safe infrastructures to ensure data security ([slides](http://bit.ly/2020cw-data-privacy)).
* Malvika Sharan gave a perspective talk on building a culture of collaboration in online communities with The Turing Way as an example for the community of practices ([slides](https://zenodo.org/record/3745008#.XpWxaTJKjOQ)).
* On the final day, a few teams with many members from The Turing Way worked under a common umbrella topic of Remote Collaboration.
* Sarah Gibson, Frances Cooper, Joanna Lang and Stephan Druskat wrote a [chapter on facilitating collaborations at remote events](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1005) that won 2nd place among the winning team.
* Patricia Herterich, Ben Krikler, Bezaye Tesfaye, Emmy Tsang, Jez Cope, Mateusz Kuzak, and Neil Chue Hong worked on [Persona and Pathways for organising hybrid events](https://github.com/softwaresaved/hybrid-event-guide) that secured 3rd place.
* The first place was secured by Yo Yehudi, Blair Archibald, David Perez-Suarez, Alison Clarke, and Marion Weinzierl who developed a Twitter bot called [RSE2-D2](https://github.com/yochannah/RSE2-D2) that provides helpful advice for research software.
