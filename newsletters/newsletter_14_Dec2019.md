Shout out to Kirstie Whitaker, Sarah Gibson, Rachael Ainsworth and Louise Bowler for representing The Turing Way at PyData Cambridge, Open Life Science mentoring program, Glasgow Women in Computing Science and The Turing Institute.

It was an eventful year for The Turing Way project and its community. We thank everyone for their contributions and highlight a few important milestones in this project.

Detailed posts on these topics are provided below ðŸ‘‡

Warm wishes for the holidays and new year!

## Community meetings

### Collaboration cafe

The next Collaboration Cafe will take place on 18 December 2019 at 19 GMT ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-12-18/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)). 
More details are available on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/sTZZwnYdS3umVWHHHLc6Mw?edit). 
This is an excellent opportunity to get to know the project, review currently open GitHub issues, contributing to one of itâ€™s chapters or include your own work in the book. 
You can sign up [here](https://hackmd.io/sTZZwnYdS3umVWHHHLc6Mw?edit) to connect with others over virtual drinks and add this event to your calendar by clicking [here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MDE4ZDdmZm9nMHFpNWVmbDlsMzhjcm5ybjggdGhldHVyaW5nd2F5QG0&tmsrc=theturingway%40gmail.com).

### The Turing Way Book dash: Applications Open!

We are accepting applications for the next Book Dash until **15 January 2019**. This event will take place on **Friday 22 February** at the Turing Institute in London. 
The main aim of this event is to facilitate in-person collaboration and content building of The Turing Way book on the topics related to data science, project design, reproducibility, ethics and community. Please send your application by filling this [online form](https://forms.gle/yWhiDKcB8mxf9Pjv8).

## News from the community

The last Collaboration Cafe took place on 21 November 2019, which was joined by multiple people from across the globe making it a highly interactive and fun session. Check out [this cheerful Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1197261780881477646) by the attendees.

Sarah Gibson was interviewed by the Open Life Science program, where she mentioned that The Turing Way allowed her to learn about Open Science while practicing it. 
You can read the [complete blog](https://t.co/id2GjQZvdx?amp=1) highlighting Sarahâ€™s contributions in reviewing the Open Life Science program. 

Rachael Ainsworth was invited by Glasgow Women in Computing Science, where she presented a talk on Open Science, research reproducibility and The Turing Way. Read [this blog](https://t.co/imzAnOmZcj?amp=1) by Frances Cooper to learn more about this event.

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

In this last newsletter of the year 2019, we want to express our gratitude towards all our community members for their involvements in The Turing Way project through various channels. 

As we celebrate the completion of this projectâ€™s one year, we want to highlight a few important events that have occurred over the last 12 months.

[The Turing Way project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) was launched by Kirstie Whitaker in February 2019 to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do". 

Within one month of its launch, three chapters were added in the handbook, a contribution guideline was collaboratively developed and the first newsletter was published. 
In the next few months, three workshops were successfully conducted on reproducibility with Binder and BinderHub, and the [The Turing Way handbook](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-02-21-inspiring-demos-are-waiting-you-collaborations-workshop-2019) was launched and demo-ed at the [Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw19) in Loughborough. 

Two book-dash events were organised in [Manchester on 16-17 May](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md) and [London on 27-28 May](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md), which were attended by 26 new members who came together to exchange their skills with others through the project by reviewing existing chapters and creating new chapters.

[The Turing Way Collaboration Cafe](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md), an online meeting series, started in September, which aims to facilitate involvement of our community members in this project. A total of 10 collaboration cafes were planned in 2019, the last one this year will take place on 18 December 2019.

The Turing Way was highlighted in a [Turing impact story](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/transforming-culture-data-science) under the title Transforming the culture of data science.

An additional funding was granted for [expanding this project into a multi-book series](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) that, in addition to reproducibility, include project design, communication, outreach, ethics and other best practices in data science. Malvika joined the core team as a community manager, who will work closely with Kirstie in enabling the planned expansion of this project.

A [book-expansion meeting](https://hackmd.io/zVTeKhG2SIiBLam1YtILNg?view) was held in October with the core members and contributors who discussed the immediate and long term plans for the project.

Turing Way was highlighted in multiple resources, presented by itâ€™s core members in several conferences, mentioned in otherâ€™s talks in different occasions and the members from other communities of practice contributed to enhancing the content of the handbook.

As we approach the end of this eventful year for The Turing Way, we thank you for joining this community, developing and improving contents with us, reaching out with your valuable feedback, discussing your ideas and engaging with the project positively. 

We wish you a warm end of the year and happy new year!
