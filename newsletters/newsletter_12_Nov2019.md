# *The Turing Way* project is expanding to a multi-volume book!

Hello Turing Way friends!

We are excited to announce that we are expanding *The Turing Way* project to a build a series of online books: "A How To Guide to Data Science".
In addition to reproducibility, this book series will explore topics such as project design, communication, outreach, ethics and other best practices in data science.

Shout out to all the contributors and community members who engaged with us in last month, joined us at the MozFest, presented a talk about this project, shared or reused *The Turing Way* resources, and acknowledged the project in their work.

If you havenâ€™t yet had a chance to say hello to us, join us at our next collaboration cafe in on 20 November 2019 (sign up at [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe)) or connect with us on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

### Collaboration Cafes

The next Collaboration Cafes will be held on 20 November 2019 at 19:00  [your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-11-20/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe).
Two more cafes have been scheduled for this year on 4 December 2019 at 15:00  [your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-12-04/15:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe), and 18 December 2019 at 19:00 [your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-11-20/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe).
Please save these dates and sign up for the next Collaboration Cafe on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe).


### Save the date: Turing Way Book Dash in February 2019

The next Book Dash will take place on `[<Date>]` at `[<Location>]`.
A Book Dash is an in-person collaborative event that brings together participants who are enthusiastic about data science and reproducibility and want to contribute to the improvement of *The Turing Way* book.
We will share more information regarding the applications in December, but meanwhile, please check the reports from the [Manchester book dash](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md) and [London book dash](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md), summarising the participants' contributions during the event and their feedback.

## News from the community

### Turing Way is Expanding!

We are excited to announce that *The Turing Way* is expanding into [a series of books](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
In addition to its previous focus on reproducibility, this project will aim to capture the vast amounts of knowledge of data science practices in the areas of project design, communication, outreach and ethics.
Following an open source, community driven approach, we will welcome contributions from anyone from within the Turing community and beyond  who can support researchers and practitioners in learning or improving the "how" of conducting world-leading research in data science.
The project proposal with further details is available [online](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/tps-funding-application-20190429.md).

To plan the next steps, the core team met last month on 11 and 12 October to brainstorm and discuss the next steps in this project.
The participants of this meeting explored a number of topics in four themed sessions, draft report from which is available on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/zVTeKhG2SIiBLam1YtILNg).

### Open Life Science Mentoring Program | Deadline Dec 8

We are delighted to collaborate with the [Open Life Science Program](https://openlifesci.org) organised by BÃ©rÃ©nice Batut, Yo Yehudi and Malvika Sharan as one of the [Mozilla Open Leader X projects](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/).
They are developing this mentoring program for mentoring and training early-stage researchers and potential academic leaders who want to become ambassadors for Life Science in their communities.
The applications can be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/ols-2020) until **December 8**.
Reach out to the core team by emailing [hello@openlifesci.org](mailto:hello@openlifesci.org) or connect with them on Twitter [@openlifesci](https://twitter.com/openlifesci).

## Tips & Tricks for new members

### How to best cite Turing Way?

Like our community members, Paola ([GitHub pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/648)) and Heidi ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya/status/1189116056641658880)), have you also wondered how to cite Turing way?
It is a fair question to ask when referring to an online Open Source project that undergoes several updates in the same week or sometimes on the same day. 

All versions of this book (available under the [cc-by license]((http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode))) can be cited using the DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853).
This DOI represents all versions, and will always resolve to the latest one.
Different versions can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and can be individually cited.

(Kirstie's very sorry that she's behind with releasing some of the versions ðŸ˜©!
If you attended a book sprint or have written chapters for the book your name will appear in that author list soon.
Promise!)

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

Kirstie Whitaker presented a talk at the Open Science Community Nijmegen on 9 October 2019 under the title [*The Turing Way*: A global collaboration for reproducible and collaborative research](https://zenodo.org/record/3478387#.XcmkDZNKjUI), and at NESTA Hack STIR event on 22 October 2019 under the title [*The Turing Way*: A handbook for reproducible research](https://zenodo.org/record/3515937#.XcmkeJNKjUI).

Thanks to several of you for joining Kirstie Whitaker, Yo Yehudi, and Malvika Sharan at the [MozFest House](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfesthouse-whyspace/en) to discuss and work on *The Turing Way* specific ideas, and discussing the project with us at the [MozFest 2019](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/).
