# The Turing Way Newsletter: 04 October 2019

Hello Turing Way friends!

This month we have been drinking virtual coffees at Calleboration Cafes :coffee: and discussing with you how you can contribute to The Turing Way project.

We ran **4 Online Collaboration Cafes** ([videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA), [more info](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md)) and partnered with the Mozilla Open Leader X [Open Life Science mentoring program](https://openlifesci.org).

Shout out to Sarah Gibson and Rachael Ainsworth who gave talks and ran a workshop on _The Turing Way_ Project.
Thanks to Paula Andrea Martinez and Philip Durbin for engaging with the project from Australia and USA üåé üåè üåç 

We are excited to meet many of you at [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/) in London, and have been thinking of ways to involve people in different time zones.

Find more details on these topics below. :point_down:

See you after Halloween! :jack_o_lantern: :maple_leaf:

## Community meetings

### Next Collaboration Cafes

This month‚Äôs collaboration cafes are scheduled on 2 October at 15:00 BST ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-10-02/15:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)), 16 October at 19:00 BST ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-10-16/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)), and 30 October at 08:00 GMT ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-10-30/08:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)).

We would love to have you on these calls to continue working together on different GitHub issues or help you get started if you are new to the project.

You can indicate your participation by signing up on this HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe), or come and say hello in our Gitter channel: [https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

### MozFest 2019

Several community members of _The Turing Way_ will be attending [Mozilla Festival 2019](https://www.mozillafestival.org) in London from 21 to 27 October.

If you are in town and also attending this conference, get in touch through our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) or other communication channels listed below this newsletter. We look forward to seeing you there in person.

## News from the community

### Collaboration Cafes online call series

Ever since their launch in September 2019, three online Collaboration Cafes have already taken place in September 2019, and one call this month on 2 October 2019.

Thanks to all our attendees for coming along and joining us to learn more about these calls, tips on community management, GitHub tricks and the project itself. You can watch the recording from these calls on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA).

Read all about this online call series on [this page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md).
We are still developing the format (see the [template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/communications/collaboration-cafe/collaboration-cafe-template.md)) and will be happy to get your feedback to make these sessions useful for you.
(For example, we've already added an "Australia-friendly" cafe on 30 October because Paula [got in touch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/684) üíñ)
There's an issue open to collected your ideas ([#711](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/711)).
Thank you in advance!

#### Online calls for different time zones

How can we involve more participants who might not be available to join us in UTC/BST? We started to discuss this topic when Paula Andrea Martinez ([orchid00](https://github.com/orchid00)), National Characterisation Training Coordinator at the Australian National Imaging Facility, expressed her interest in attending The Turing Way Collaboration Cafe in Australian time zone [ACT](https://www.google.com/search?q=asutralian+time+zone&oq=asutralian+time+zone&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3623j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). To make this happen, we have added a new call on 30 October at 8:00 BST/18:00 ACT ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-10-30/08:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)).

If you live in a country that is not compatible with our [current schedule](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md#attending-an-online-collaboration-cafe) and if you would like to join a call in the future, please add your comment in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/711).

## Relevant resources

### Open Life Science Mentoring Program

The Turing Way is delighted to collaborate with the [Open Life Science Program](https://openlifesci.org) organised by B√©r√©nice Batut, Yo Yehudi and Malvika Sharan as one of the [Mozilla Open Leader X projects](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). They are developing this mentoring program for early-stage researchers who want to become ambassadors for Open Life Science in their communities. A call for application for mentees and mentors will be announced soon. Stay up to date through their webpage (https://openlifesci.org/).

## Acknowledgements and celebrations!

Shout out to two of our members [Sarah Gibson](https://twitter.com/drsarahlgibson) and [Rachael Ainsworth](https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn), who represented The Turing Way project at two separate conferences in September.

Sarah, Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, delivered a successful workshop on building a [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and _The Turing Way_ at the [RSEconUK 2019](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/).
She shared her training materials in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/build-a-binderhub/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binderhub.md) and online via Zenodo (DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3382208](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3382208)).

Rachael, Community Manager of Software Sustainability Institute, attended the Open Science Fair 2019 in Porto, Portugal, last month, where she presented a poster (DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3381445](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3381445)) and a [demo session](https://www.opensciencefair.eu/demos-2019/the-turing-way-a-handbook-for-reproducible-data-science) (DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3403160](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3403160)) on _The Turing Way_ project.
Her demo session was also featured by The ORION Open Science Podcast in the episode [The FAIR is in Town: figshare, The Turing Way, and Open Science Quest at the OSFAIR2019](https://orionopenscience.podbean.com/e/the-fair-is-in-town-figshare-the-turing-way-and-open-science-quest-at-the-osfair2019/)! :tada:
