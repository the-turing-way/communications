## Community News and Updates

### GitHub Organisation Plans for *The Turing Way*

Over the past year, it has become clear that *The Turing Way* has expanded greatly in size and would benefit from having its own [GitHub organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).
Anne has consulted with our Translation and Localisation Working Group members who already use an organisation to maintain different resources for their work, as well as discussed with the project leads to assess the crucial roles of a GitHub organisation on the community-led work.

With these details, our Infrastructure Working Group will lead the scoping and implementation plans, as well as inform the transition timeline and process.
At a recent Collaboration Caf√©, they also had an open discussion with the Translation and Localisation team to understand the various needs and challenges, notes from which are shared on [issue #3255](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/3255).

**Follow and join this discussion on GitHub Organisation for *The Turing Way* on [issue #3213](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/3213)**.

### Updates from *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub's First Workshop

On Thursday 27 July 2023, *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub hosted their first hybrid workshop hosted at The Alan Turing Institute's office in London, UK.

![Alt: Picture of attendees of the Practitioners Hub workshop, taken at The Alan Turing office in London, on the back wall there is colourful painting of Alan Turing. Standing, from left to right: Malvika Sharan, Lucy Stephenson, Lauren Wool, Vicky Hellon and Brian Tarran. Sitting, from left to right: Rowan Hemsi, Neil Chue Hong, Kirstie Whitaker, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez and Raphael Sonabend](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1uA0IBon.png)

_From left to right (standing): Malvika Sharan, Lucy Stephenson, Lauren Wool, Vicky Hellon, Brian Tarran. (Seated): Rowan Hemsi, Neil Chue Hong, Kirstie Whitaker, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez and Raphael Sonabend_

The [Experts in Residence](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub/eirs) came together for a day to discuss their roles, challenges with adopting data science best practices in their respective fields and to what future directions they can collectively work towards.

A public keynote panel was facilitated by [Jennifer Ding](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/business-team/jennifer-ding) on **"Exploring cross-sector needs, challenges, and opportunities"**, with the invited speakers [Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker), [Simon Reeve](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/simon-reeve), [Lauren Wool](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-e-wool-13b09b6a/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [Neil Chue Hong](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/staff/person/neil-chue-hong).

**You can [watch the keynote panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR3OoZs0JRk).**
