This event will start on the evening of 20 February 2020 with an introduction to the project, which will be followed by an official dinner. 
The complete day of 21 February 2020 will be dedicated to the project content development. 
Your contributions may include, but are not limited to: science communication - skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications, great examples and case studies of reproducible research, writing new chapters, editing the current chapters and updating how the book looks online (CSS, logos, layout etc). 

## News from the community

***Boost your research reproducibility with Binder workshops in Cambridge***
 
[The British Antarctic Survey](www.bas.ac.uk) is hosting a half-day workshop on 31 January 2020 from 13:30 to 17:00 on research reproducibility in The Turing Way project. 
At this workshop, the trainers will discuss reproducible computing environments, with examples of others‚Äô projects in myBinder.org to help you learn how to prepare a binder-ready project. 
At the end of the workshop, you will be able to take some of your own content (in R, Jupyter notebook, or scripts that can be run in the terminal) and prepare it so that it can be used by others on myBinder.org. 
For registration, please contact Dr. Anita Faul from the Artificial Intelligence Lab of British Antarctic Survey by emailing [anfaul@bas.ac.uk](mailto:anfaul@bas.ac.uk).

One more Binder workshop will be hosted by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge on 29 January 2020. Sarah Gibson will be teaching at this workshop, details of which can be found [here](SARAH WILL ADD LINK HERE).

## Tips & Tricks for new contributors

Have you ever wondered what are the pathways to contribute to _The Turing Way_ project and how getting involved in the community can benefit you? 
You can find that out by reading [impact statements](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/project_management/impact_statements) from our active contributors. 
[Patricia](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/impact_statements/patricia_herterich.md), the Research Data Specialist at Digital Curation Centre, states that *contributing to the Turing Way helped her identify which activities she wants to focus on in her career going forward*. 
[Rachael](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/impact_statements/rachael-ainsworth.md), the Research Software Community Manager at SSI, states that *being a core member empowered her to pursue a community management position in the domain of open research*.

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

***Congratulations Software Sustainability Institute‚Äôs (SSI) Fellows 2020***


[Tweet](https://twitter.com/SoftwareSaved/status/1215572740381372416?s=20) from the official Twitter page of SSI.

This year, among [18 SSI fellowship](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows?_ga=2.125569866.1329264381.1579011146-1585188985.1568709796) recipients are several of our valuable contributors. This fantastic set of fellows include two of our core members, Sarah Gibson and Jez Cope. 
Sarah aims to [build a welcoming community of reproducible research](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/sarah-gibson) by encouraging contributions, promoting diversity and transparency, and fostering collaborations. 
Jez is interested in developing [infrastructure and practices to archive and preserve research data and software for the future](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/jez-cope). 

Two more fellows, [Alex Clarke](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/alex-clarke) and [Will Hulme](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/will-hulme), are contributors of _The Turing Way_ project at the Book Dash events in 2019.
We also extend our wishes to [Tarek Allam](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/tarek-allam) who is a member of The Alan Turing Institute.

We are really thrilled to have their works and efforts recognized by this prestigious fellowship.

SSI fellowships are awarded every year to open science advocates for supporting their effort as ambassadors in their respective fields. More details in [this blog post](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-01-10-announcing-2020-software-sustainability-institute-fellows).

***The Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop 2020 (CW20)***

The Software Sustainability Institute‚Äôs [Collaborations Workshop 2020 (CW20)](http://bit.ly/ssi-cw20) will take place from 31 March - 2 April 2020 at [Queen's University Belfast](http://qub.ac.uk/), Northern Ireland and registration is now open on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/collaborations-workshop-2020-cw20-collabw20-tickets-72375437883?aff=TuringWay)! 
This workshop brings together researchers, developers, innovators, managers, funders, publishers, leaders and educators to explore best practices and the future of research software. The themes of the keynote presentations, demos, discussion groups, panel sessions and more at CW20 are: Open Research, Data Privacy and Software Sustainability. 
The [call for proposals for mini-workshop and demo sessions](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/call-proposals-mini-workshops-and-demo-sessions-collaborations-workshop-2020) is open until 31 January, and these sessions are unique opportunities for CW20 participants and sponsors to share a particular software product, approach, standard, or other idea relating to the workshop themes, research software and pitches for the Hackday.



***Librarians Building Momentum for Reproducibility Logistics Program***

Registration is open for a virtual half-day conference for librarians who are working in, or want to learn more about, supporting research reproducibility. 
This event will take place on January 28, 2020 at 9:00-3:00pm PST, 12:00-6:00pm EST. They are are running this conference completely online, through the videoconferencing tool Zoom. 
You are free to participate in the conference from wherever you can connect to the Internet! Check details on [their official website](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/librarians-reproducibility/).


***The Whole Tale Open Source Platform for Reproducible Research***

The [Whole Tale project](https://wholetale.org/)  is an NSF-funded initiative building a scalable, open source platform for reproducible research.
Whole Tale supports the creation, publication, and execution of _tales_ -- executable research artifacts that capture, data, code and the complete software environment required to reproduce computational results.
They along with Harvard Dataverse team have set up a platform to demonstrate _tales_ using the Whole Tale platform as a dataset-level external tool on the demo instance at https://demo.dataverse.org.

Check out examples for two different use cases: 1) [Whole Tale as Dataverse External Tool](https://youtu.be/AoSpQ3A7poY), demonstrating how Whole Tale can be used to launch an RStudio (or other) environment for exploration of "replication datasets" that contain code. 2) [Registering data for analysis in Whole Tale](https://youtu.be/oWEcFpEUmrU), demonstrating how source datasets can be registered in Whole Tale for analysis using RStudio with automatic citation. A [short document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ln4wUTsBZ1mP9qUGGwfkM6p8bpmPSBRAvAWOkz2U_L) further describes the integration and planned features for anyone interested.
