# Upcoming Events

## Tune into our Fireside Chat üî•

![](https://i.imgur.com/CQFTKn8.jpg)

**On 29 April 2022, 15:00-16:30 UTC ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2022-04-29/15:00)): the next fireside chat will take place on the topic: ‚ÄúEnabling Inclusive Conferencing in the 'Post-Pandemic Era'‚Äù.** Over the past 2 and a half years, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a reckoning with how scientific research is done across international borders ‚Äì and how scientific conferencing is done in turn. Alongside the shift to ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù, conferences also moved online. But as many events begin to move back to in-person events in the coming months and years, this Fireside chat brings together diverse voices from different projects and communities to talk more about the role of conferences in scientific collaboration, and the trade-offs involved in this shift back to in-person conferences.

**Chaired by Anne Lee Steele, this panel will feature insights from Dorothea Hug Peter, Elio Campitelli, Lilly Winfree, Gilbert Beyamba, and Ben Krikler.** These researchers represent different communities with expertise and insights from working with and participating in conferences (read their bios below). We will also facilitate open discussions with attendees to learn about their perspectives on the topic via a shared document (links shared upon registration). [Sign up on the Eventbrite here.](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-making-virtual-participation-a-global-default-tbc-tickets-318719758377)

## Sign up for our Book Dash üìöüí®

**The 7th [Book Dash](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) event will take place online from 16 to 20 May 2022.** Submit your application via this [Google form](https://forms.gle/uEbu1FJMmdfgGwvW6). The Deadline for submission is 21 April 2022.

We invite applications from members of our community, including both new and existing contributors. Our attendees bring some understanding of where they can contribute and collaboratively improve The Turing Way as a whole. If participating in The Turing Way community for the first time, we encourage you to first participate in a Collaboration Caf√© or other community events (see: below or bit.ly/turingway).

This application will likely take 30 minutes to complete. You can use this template document with all the questions to prepare your draft in your time.: https://tinyurl.com/tw-bookdash-template.

While we won't be extending the deadline, please reach out to Anne at asteele@turing.ac.uk if you think you'll need need more time to complete the application. If you'd like to work with someone on drafting your application, please join us at Collaboration Cafe. Don't hesitate to reach out ‚Äì we're here to give you the support you need.

Don't forget that Book Dashes usually end with a [Community Share Out and Contributor Celebrations Event](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-events.html#community-share-outs-contributor-celebration), which you can sign up for on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-community-share-out-and-contributor-celebrations-may-2022-tickets-323373307267).

## Join us at Collaboration Cafe ‚òï

**The next Collaboration Caf√© will be hosted by Malvika Sharan, Arielle Bennett, and Emma Karoune TODAY on 20 April 2022 15:00 UTC+1.** They will be hosting a room on pre-applications discussions for the upcoming Book Dash.

Please find details and sign up here: [hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe).

You can also sign up to host one of the future Collaboration Caf√©s on 4 May and 18 May 2022. We hope to see you there!

# Community News

## Featured: UK's Goldacre review!

![](https://i.imgur.com/RFFH8iP.jpg)

We are thrilled and honoured that [The Turing Way was recently featured in the Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis). You can read the [full report online here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis), or [download the PDF here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067053/goldacre-review-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis.pdf).

Led by Dr. Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford, the report explored how health data can be used efficiently and safely by researchers and for patients within the heathcare sector. The study was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health and Care in the UK. [Learn more about the Goldacre Review here](https://www.goldacrereview.org/).

## New chapter: Peer Review!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lfr2AzN.png)

Lena Karvovskaya ([@LangData](https://twitter.com/LangData/)), recently published a new chapter in the Turing Way on [Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review/peer-review-overview.html)! You can find [the new chapter in our Guide for Communication]((https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/)).

This new chapter includes helpful suggestions on what to do before accepting an invitation for peer review, and how to structure writing one. It also includes tips drawn from work by Rene Bekkers, called ["How to review a paper"](https://renebekkers.wordpress.com/2020/06/24/how-to-review-a-paper/). Thank you to Lena for writing, and to Vicky Hellon, Emma Karoune, and Achintya Rao for reviews!

If you'd like to get involved with new and ongoing chapters, please get in touch with us: join a co-working hour, collaboration cafe, or message one of the team directly. See below for details.

## Co-leads of the new Translation and Localisation team!

# Opportunities in the Turing Orbit

## Upcoming event: Tools, Practices & Systems Programme Seminar

‚è∞ Registration link: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMtc-qtpzsqE9DB9M9x4_kpcnYN_e-bJP3d
üóìÔ∏è Wednesday 27 April 2022 | 12:30 - 14:00

**Join the Turing's Tools, Practices & Systems programme at their monthly seminar. This month, they'll be welcoming James Muldoon (author of Platform Socialism - Social Ownership in the Digital Economy).**

Tech companies have been criticised for their surveillance practices, privacy breaches and monopolistic ambitions. Instead of inquiring as to how we could ‚Äòfix‚Äô Facebook this paper explores alternatives that could replace them. It presents the idea of platform socialism - the organisation of the digital economy through the social ownership of digital assets and democratic control over the infrastructure and systems that govern our digital lives. This framework facilitates holistic thinking about the systemic nature of the problems we face and the need for genuine alternatives. To develop the principles and institutional sketch of platform socialism, I draw inspiration from the writings of two early twentieth century writers: the libertarian socialist, G. D. H. Cole and the Austrian philosopher and economist Otto Neurath. I propose new forms of participatory and decentralised governance through an ecosystem of alternative ownership models of digital platforms. How would socially-owned and controlled apps operate in transport, food delivery and short-term accommodation? Drawing from historical examples and contemporary prototypes, platform socialism examines a variety of ways communities could reclaim ownership and control over digital platforms.

## Introduction to Data Science and AI Training: Review and Illustration Sprint

Lydia France, Federico Nanni ([@f_nanni](https://twitter.com/f_nanni)) and Malvika ([@MalvikaSharan](https://twitter.com/MalvikaSharan)) are developing training materials for data science for biomedical researchers on GitHub (see an [early Tweet inviting case studies and examples](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1491849730996981770?s=20&t=RENtZhQDQ2WWCclDxxhjlA)). They are organising a review and illustration sprint for the [Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience).
This project has led to the development of **two training modules** on data science and AI practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs, and mid to late-career biomedical scientists.
**Note: They encourage anyone with overlapping experience in biomedical research and computational best practices with some project management skills to join them at this event.**
