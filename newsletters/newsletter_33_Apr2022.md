# Upcoming Events

## Tune into our Fireside Chat üî•

![](https://i.imgur.com/CQFTKn8.jpg)

**On 29 April 2022, 15:00-16:30 UTC ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2022-04-29/15:00)): the next fireside chat will take place on the topic: ‚ÄúEnabling Inclusive Conferencing in the 'Post-Pandemic Era'‚Äù.**
Over the past 2 and a half years, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a reckoning with how scientific research is done across international borders ‚Äì and how scientific conferencing is done in turn.
Alongside the shift to ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù, conferences also moved online.
But as many events begin to move back to in-person events in the coming months and years, this Fireside chat brings together diverse voices from different projects and communities to talk more about the role of conferences in scientific collaboration, and the trade-offs involved in this shift back to in-person conferences.

**Chaired by Anne Lee Steele, this panel will feature insights from Dorothea Hug Peter, Elio Campitelli, Lilly Winfree, Gilbert Beyamba, and Ben Krikler.** These individuaals represent different communities with expertise and insights from organising and participating in international conferences.  
[Sign up on the Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-making-virtual-participation-a-global-default-tbc-tickets-318719758377).

## Community News

### Featured: UK's Goldacre review!

![Alt:Screenshot of Goldacre report page and title](https://i.imgur.com/RFFH8iP.jpg)
_The Goldacre Review was published on 7 April 2022._

We are thrilled and honoured that [_The Turing Way_ was recently featured in the Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis).
You can read the [full report online](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis).

Led by Dr. Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford, the report explored how health data can be used efficiently and safely by researchers and for patients within the heathcare sector.
The study was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health and Care in the UK.
[Learn more about the Goldacre Review](https://www.goldacrereview.org/).

### New chapter: Peer Review!

![Alt:Screenshot of tweet by Lena](https://i.imgur.com/Lfr2AzN.png)
_Lena's tweet about the new chapter!_

Lena Karvovskaya recently published a new chapter in the Turing Way on [Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review/peer-review-overview.html)!
You can find [the new chapter in our Guide for Communication]((https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/)).
This new chapter includes helpful suggestions on what to do before accepting an invitation for peer review, and how to structure writing one.
It also includes tips drawn from work by Rene Bekkers, called ["How to review a paper"](https://renebekkers.wordpress.com/2020/06/24/how-to-review-a-paper/).
Thank you to Lena for writing, and to Vicky Hellon, Emma Karoune, and Achintya Rao for reviews!

If you'd like to get involved with new and ongoing chapters, please get in touch with us: join a co-working hour, collaboration cafe, or message one of the team directly.

## Co-leads of _The Turing Way_ Translation and Localisation team!

## Opportunities in the Turing Orbit

### Introduction to Data Science and AI Training: Review and Illustration Sprint

‚è∞ Express your interest to attend the review sprint before **21 April 2022** via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/fXPZ9yPzMkqMxrdQ8).
üóìÔ∏è Program dates: Thursday, 28 and Friday, 29 April 2022 (1.5 days)

Lydia France, Federico Nanni and Malvika are developing training materials for data science for biomedical researchers: [Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience).
These materials cover a range of topics on data science and AI practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs, and mid to late-career biomedical scientists in twi training madules.

They are hosting a review and illustration sprint on 28 and 29 April and inviting applications from external members to review, give feedback and improve these materials for their use.
Participants can choose to attend from **five 2-hour long sessions for collaborative review** of these training materials.
They will also work with a professional scribe from [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.com/) to help develop accessible illustrations to include in the materials.

### Upcoming event: Tools, Practices & Systems Programme Seminar

‚è∞ Registration link: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMtc-qtpzsqE9DB9M9x4_kpcnYN_e-bJP3d
üóìÔ∏è Wednesday 27 April 2022 | 12:30 - 14:00

**Join the Turing's Tools, Practices & Systems programme at their monthly seminar. This month, they'll be welcoming James Muldoon (author of Platform Socialism - Social Ownership in the Digital Economy).**

Tech companies have been criticised for their surveillance practices, privacy breaches and monopolistic ambitions.
Instead of inquiring as to how we could ‚Äòfix‚Äô Facebook this paper explores alternatives that could replace them.
It presents the idea of platform socialism - the organisation of the digital economy through the social ownership of digital assets and democratic control over the infrastructure and systems that govern our digital lives.
This framework facilitates holistic thinking about the systemic nature of the problems we face and the need for genuine alternatives.
To develop the principles and institutional sketch of platform socialism, I draw inspiration from the writings of two early twentieth century writers: the libertarian socialist, G. D. H. Cole and the Austrian philosopher and economist Otto Neurath.
I propose new forms of participatory and decentralised governance through an ecosystem of alternative ownership models of digital platforms.
How would socially-owned and controlled apps operate in transport, food delivery and short-term accommodation? Drawing from historical examples and contemporary prototypes, platform socialism examines a variety of ways communities could reclaim ownership and control over digital platforms.
