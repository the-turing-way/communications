# The Turing Way - March update

Dear friends of the Turing Way,

We’re close to the official launch of the Turing Way and thus, we thought it’s time for an update.

## Workshops
We ran three successful workshops in March – many thanks to those who attended!

### [Boost your research reproducibility with Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder)
Our two workshops to boost research reproducibility with Binder in Manchester and London were attended by 30 people. 
A mix of presentations and hands-on exercises provided attendees with enough confidence to use Binder for their work.

### [Build a BinderHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/build-a-binderhub)
We hosted the first ever Build a BinderHub workshop in Sheffield on 18 March 2019. 
In addition to learning how to build a BinderHub (and having the most BinderHubs ever in existence in parallel!), participants were introduced to [Mozilla's principles of working openly](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/).
They practically applied the principles and fed back ideas for new features to the Binder community or enhanced the existing documentation. 

All workshop materials are available on our GitHub repository and can be re-used to run your own Binder based sessions!

## Handbook
Our handbook is shaping up and most of the chapters are written and ready for review. 
We moved them into a [separate repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way-book/) for the book and are working on turning it into a jupyterbook for the launch.

### Join us for the launch!
Most of the Turing Way team will be at the [Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw19) in Loughborough 1 - 3 April 2019. 
We hope to see many of you there for [the launch demo](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-02-21-inspiring-demos-are-waiting-you-collaborations-workshop-2019) of our handbook and plenty of insightful discussions!

## Have your say!
We would still love you to share your tips, tricks and gotchas with the Turing Way community!
To add your advice to the handbook, please fill out our quick [submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/akFqZEIy2kxAjfZW2).

Colleagues from Research England are interested in understanding how researchers think the research landscape (i.e. research outputs, impacts and the research environment) might change over the next 5 to 10 years. 
You can still fill [their survey]( https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/nationalresearchsurvey) by **1 April 2019**.


Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your contributions!
