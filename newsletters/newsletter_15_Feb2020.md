Thanks to our friends, Naomi Penfold and Stafanie Butland, for mentioning this co-working event on their blog post - [Online Co-working Partnerships are Community of Practice in Action](https://www.cscce.org/2020/02/04/online-co-working-partnerships-are-community-of-practice-in-action/#more-3009).

Shout out to Ang Li and Yini He for translating 4 chapters of *The Turing Way* in Chinese. 
Thanks to Tony Yang who is establishing a system within the project to facilitate an effective translation process in Chinese. 
They invite more members from the community to join them in their effort by translating *The Turing Way* in Chinese or other languages.

We are delighted to announce that we will be welcoming 15 of members at the book dash on 20 and 21 February.

## Community meetings

### Collaborate Cafes

Join us at the next collaboration cafe on 19 February at 19:00 GMT ([your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-02-19/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)). Sign up on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe). 
These online meetings are held using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to co-work without distractions to add your contributions to *The Turing Way* project.
These contributions can be from fixing bugs to reviewing existing chapters or adding your own content to the book. 
*The Turing Way* team members will be present to help you troubleshoot and answer your questions. 
Thanks to the positive response from our past attendees, we will continue to hold these working hours on the first Wednesdays at 15:00 GMT and third Wednesday at 19:00 GMT of each month. 
You can see the exact date and time for the next few sessions on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md).

## News from the community

### Congratulations to our 15 selected book dash participants!

We are excited to announce that 15 members have been invited to attend the upcoming book dash hosted at The Alan Turing Institute, London from 20 to 21 February 2020. 
These members are (listed alphabetically): [Adina Wagner](https://twitter.com/AdinaKrik), [Alex Chan](https://twitter.com/alexwlchan), [Anna Hadjitofi](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/anna-hadjitofi), [Arielle Bennett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ariellebennett), [Barbara Vreede](https://twitter.com/barbaravreede), [Christina Hitrova](https://twitter.com/C_Hitrova), [Esther Plomp](https://twitter.com/PhDToothFAIRy), [Frances Madden](https://twitter.com/maddenfc), [Heidi Seibold](https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya), [Kesson Magid](https://twitter.com/kesson), [Martina G. Vilas](https://twitter.com/martinagvilas), [Mateusz Kuzak](https://twitter.com/matkuzak), [Nathan Begbie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-begbie-161902173/), [Nicol√°s Alessandroni](https://twitter.com/nalessandroni), and [Tony Yang](https://twitter.com/tony_yzy). 
One of the past attendees, [Jade Pickering](https://twitter.com/Jade_Pickering) will be returning as a helper along with the core contributors Louise Bowler and Sarah Gibson. 
Those who are not located in London have also received travel and accommodation support from *The Turing Way* project. 
We are looking forward to welcoming them and working with them in person! 

#### Your comments are needed on the rubric for selection

A call for application was opened in December 2019, inviting applications from the interested candidates sharing their ideas for contribution to *The Turing Way* project. 
They were also asked to justify how they will benefit from their participation at this event. 
We adapted the Mozilla Open Leadership selection rubric for ranking and scoring all the applications. This rubric is currently available in this [pull request (#804)](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/804). 
We welcome your comments and suggestions on this rubric for the selection process in our future events.

### Translating *The Turing Way* in Other Languages

Ang Li and Yini He have translated 4 initial chapters of *The Turing Way* in Chinese. 
These young researchers from China are spending a year in The Alan Turing Institute in the [Whitaker Lab](https://twitter.com/Whitaker_Lab) and are working on different topics in the neurobiology field while contributing to *The Turing Way* project.

Tony Yang, who is conducting his PhD research at Imperial College London has set out to develop standardised guidelines and infrastructure for translation efforts in Chinese and other languages within the community. 
He will be working with Turing Way team members during the book dash in integrating this workflow in the main project pipeline.

A past book dash attendee, Camila Rangel-Smith and her colleague Reina Camacho Toro have expressed interest in beginning to translate a few existing chapters in Spanish.

We are so grateful for their work so far and invite our Chinese- and Spanish-speaking members to join this effort. Connect with them [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/767).

## Tips & Tricks for new contributors

Wondering how getting involved with this community influences our contributors? 
Our core contributors share their experiences as ‚Äúimpact statements‚Äù.

This month we want to highlight the impact statements by [Louise Bowler](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/impact_statements/louise-bowler.md) and [Sarah Gibson](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/impact_statements/sarah-gibson.md).

Louise started to contribute to this project as part of the Turing's Reproducible Research Champions programme. 
She worked on improving the reproducibility of recent papers written by Turing researchers, a write-up for which will appear at the end of the relevant chapters, with links to the code and guidance on how to set up and use the projects. 

> ‚Äú*The Turing Way* is the first large-scale open source project that I've been part of, and I found it a very positive experience. 
The enthusiasm we were met with each time we presented the project has definitely encouraged me towards adopting more open working practices in the future.‚Äù - **Louise Bowler**

Sarah started by providing technical support to the project for reproducible computational environments and the Champions project by using [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

> ‚ÄúBy being a visible member of the team at a range of research-based events, I have been able to champion reproducibility, *The Turing Way* and Binder projects throughout the research community and disseminate the lessons I've learned through the workshops I've presented.‚Äù - **Sarah Gibson**

*If you want to share your impact story, get in touch with us or send your [pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls) for your impact statement to be included [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/project_management/impact_statements).*
