# The Turing Way -  Book dash reports

Dear friends of the Turing Way,

it's been quiet here for a while as we've been so busy running book dashes that resulted in amazing new contributions to the book.

## GitHub repository update
After we announced in our last newsletter that we split off the handbook in a separate GitHub repository to the main project repository, we decided to move the book back into the main Turing Way repository. 
We realized that there wasn't a technical reason for having the book in a separate repository and splitting discussions across two repositories is rather confusing. 
Thus, you can find everything at https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way and we have now also preserved various releases of the handbook [on zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853).

## Book dashes 

We were busy organising and running two very succcessful book dashes in May. 
Our events in Manchester and London were great opportunities to grow the Turing Way community and we were really lucky to be joined by an illustrator from [scriberia](http://www.scriberia.co.uk/) who captured our book dahes wonderfully:

The Turing Way team was joined by 26 enthusiastic participants that provided a wide range of contributions to the Turing Way handbook:
* Proofreading and editing of existing chapters.
* Further information added to existing chapters.
* Writing new chapters, for example on Reproducible data analysis pipelines for machine learning, Credit for reproducible research, and Outreach and Communicating Results to Others.
* Reviewed pull requests.
* Restructuring of the chapter sections.

Full reports on our book dashes including feedback from our participants are available on GitHub:
* [Manchester book dash report](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md)
* [London book dash report](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md)

The illustrations will be made available under a [CC-BY licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) soon.

## Spreading the word
### Talks and hackathons
The team has been spreading the word about the Turing Way project through various talks:

* Kirstie and Patricia were be at the [inaugural meeting of the UK network of Open Research Working Groups](https://sites.google.com/view/ukoswg19) at Aston University, Birmingham on 11 April 2019. Patricia presented on the Turing Way and her slides can be found [on zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2634185).
* Kirstie gave a keynote on the Turing Way at the [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon on 8 and 9 May 2019. A recording of her talk is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE) and her slides can be found [on zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669548).
* Sarah Gibson attended the Microsoft Reactor Research Software Engineering Hackday and led a team on BinderHub that improved [our Zero to BinderHub instructions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/build-a-binderhub/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binderhub.md).

### Where to meet us in the next few weeks

* Rosie Higman will present on the Turing Way at the NOWAL Research Support meeting [in Manchester on 13 June 2019](https://www.nowal.ac.uk/research-support-open-research-exchange-experience-university-manchester).
* Kirstie Whitaker will re-run a shortened version of our March "Boost your reproducibilty with Binder" workshop at [Carpentry Connect in Manchester on 26 June 2019](https://www.software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme). 
Turing Way team member Anna Krystalli will run a ReproHack, a one day hackathon that will attempt to reproduce results in published papers.
* Rosie Higman and Patricia Herterich will present the Turing Way at [the 48th LIBER Annual Conference in Dublin on 26 June 2019](https://liberconference.eu/schedule/).
* Sarah Gibson will re-run a shortened version of our March "Build a BinderHub" workshop at the [RSEConf 2019 in Birmingham 17 - 19 September 2019](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/).


Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your contributions!
